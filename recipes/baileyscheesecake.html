      <li>sweetened whipped cream for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) with rack in lower
        third position. Lightly grease an 8-inch springform pan with cooking
        spray and line with parchment on the bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Process cookies in a food processor until ground into small crumbs, 2 to
        3 minutes. Pour in melted butter and process for another 30 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Press evenly into bottom and about 1 inch up sides of prepared pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until firm and fragrant, 10 to 12 minutes.
        Let cool slightly while making the filling, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Reduce oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Once crust is cooled, wrap bottom of pan with 2 layers of heavy-duty
        aluminum foil to prevent water from seeping into pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the cheesecake filling: Add cream cheese to the bowl of a stand
        mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat on medium-low speed
        until creamy, about 2 minutes. Add sour cream, and beat on medium-low
        speed until fully combined, scraping down sides of bowl halfway through,
        about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat in sugar, espresso powder, vanilla, and salt, until combined,
        scraping down the sides of the bowl halfway through, about 1 minute. Add
        eggs, 1 at a time, beating on low speed just until combined after each
        addition and scraping down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula, 1 to 2
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Baileys and beat on low speed until just combined, about 45 seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour filling onto cooled crust. Place springform pan into a larger
        roasting pan and place in preheated oven. Pour 1 1/2 cups of water in
        roasting pan and bake until the cheesecake is almost set (the center 2
        inches should jiggle slightly) and edges have pulled away slightly from
        pan, 50 to 60 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off oven and leave door cracked open about 7 to 8 inches; let
        cheesecake stand in oven 30 minutes. Remove from oven and carefully lift
        cheesecake from water bath. Cover and chill at least 3 hours or
        overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the ganache: Heat cream and Baileys in a small saucepan over
        medium heat until warm to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in espresso
        powder until fully combined. Add chocolate chips and let stand 1 minute;
        stir until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove cheesecake from pan and place on a cake plate. Pour ganache
        evenly over chilled cheesecake, spreading slightly over edges with an
        offset spatula. Refrigerate until ganache is firm, about 30 minutes.
