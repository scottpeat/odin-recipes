    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Truly authentic Italian carbonara with bacon coal miners' recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
      <li>12 slices thick-cut, applewood-smoked bacon</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¼ cup dry vermouth</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup whipping cream (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 12 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high
        heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
        Drain bacon slices on paper towels. Reserve 2 tablespoons bacon fat in
        the skillet and discard the rest. Chop bacon when cool enough to handle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and onion to reserved bacon fat in the
        skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until the onion has softened and
        turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant,
        about 1 minute. Pour vermouth into the pan and bring to a boil while
        scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the pan with a
        wooden spoon, about 1 minute. Mix in chopped bacon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drain spaghetti, transfer to a large serving bowl, and mix in remaining
        1 tablespoon oil. Add bacon-onion mixture, Parmesan cheese, cream, eggs,
        and pepper to the hot pasta; stir until spaghetti is well coated and
        sauce is creamy.
      </li>
    </ol>
